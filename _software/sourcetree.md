I love the terminal.
I use git primarily from the terminal and have heavily modified it to work exactly the way I want it to.
However, there is a high price to working in the terminal.
Everything new thing you want to do requires some degree of research.
From a minute to an day, each new thing you learn needs to be weighed with the question, 'Is it worth learning this'.
Many other people have covered this topic, most iconically in the xkcd cartoon ['Is It Worth the Time?'][1].

This is where SourceTree comes in.
SourceTree is not the nicest or easiest to use git client out there.
Git Kraken, Git Tower, and even GitHub Desktop have it beat in most git related operations.
It also doesn't work nicely with rebasing.

Where SourceTree excels is in the things I'm not able to do easily in the terminal.
Namely staging and unstaging hunks and lines.
I haven't found any other client that does this as well.

Not everyone should use SourceTree, but everyone should question how much they learn in the terminal.
